The creations they built in blocks are often reminiscent of things they have seen, and so they will begin to name what they built. Tawona explained “Look Dev I’m making a robot, do you like my robot Dev?” Dev replied” Wow, I’m making a tower” Isabella added “I’m making a house for my horsey” Dev replied “Your horsey can live in my tower Isabella!” Tawona commented” Horsey’s don’t live in a tower!” Dev, Tawona and Isabella laughed whilst Pashav was making a train.'
